# 🛡️ Pallet Ledger Pro: Enterprise Logistics System

**Pallet Ledger Pro** is a secure, local-first logistics platform designed to track inventory across multiple operational bases. Built for teams of 50+ employees, it uses a **Double-Entry Ledger** system (similar to a bank) to ensure every asset is accounted for and nothing goes missing during transit.

---

## 🌟 Capabilities & Features

* **Zero-Loss Tracking:** Every item movement is a transaction. If 50 pallets leave Base A, they *must* arrive at Base B or stay in "Transit".
* **Role-Based Security:**
* **Commanders:** Full system access, user management, and audit logs.
* **Logistics Officers:** Can record movements and manage inventory.
* **Viewers:** Read-only access to dashboards.


* **Predictive Analytics:** Automatically calculates "Burn Rates" to warn you days before a location runs out of stock.
* **Audit Trails:** A permanent, unalterable log of who moved what, when, and why.

## 🛠️ The Technology Stack

This project uses modern, enterprise-grade tools to ensure stability, security, and scalability for a mid-sized company.

1. **Frontend:** **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)**
* Builds the interactive web dashboard completely in Python.
* *Why we use it:* It enables rapid data visualization and a clean, responsive UI without complex JavaScript.


2. **Backend Logic:** **[Python 3.13+](https://www.python.org/)**
* Handles all business logic, stock calculations, and data processing.


3. **Database:** **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**
* An industrial-strength relational database that stores Users, Locations, and the Ledger.
* *Why we use it:* It guarantees data integrity (ACID compliance), crucial for financial or inventory ledgers.


4. **Security:** **[Bcrypt](https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/)**
* Encrypts user passwords using industry-standard hashing algorithms. Passwords are never stored as plain text.


5. **Infrastructure:** **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)**
* Packages the entire app (Frontend, Backend, Database) into a single "container".
* *Benefit:* The app runs exactly the same on any computer (Mac, Windows, Linux) with zero manual configuration.

## 🚀 Installation Guide (Step-by-Step)

### **Prerequisites**

* **Docker Desktop:** [Download Here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). Ensure it is installed and running (look for the green whale icon).

### **Step 1: Setup the Project**

1. Unzip the project folder to your server or computer (e.g., `Desktop/pallet-ledger`).
2. Open the folder in your terminal or VS Code.

### **Step 2: Create the Secret Configuration**

1. Inside the root folder, create a new file named exactly **`.env`**.
2. Paste the following connection string inside it and save:
```env
# Database Connection for Docker Network
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:12345@postgres:5432/pallet_ledger"

```



### **Step 3: Launch the System**

1. Open your terminal in the project folder.
2. Run this command to build and start the system:
```bash
docker-compose up --build

```


3. **Wait:** The first installation takes 2-5 minutes. When the terminal says `Streamlit run app.py`, the system is live.

## 🖥️ How to Use (For Staff)

### **1. Login**

Open your web browser (Chrome/Edge/Safari) and navigate to:
👉 **[http://localhost:8501](https://www.google.com/search?q=http://localhost:8501)**

* **Default Admin:** `admin`
* **Default Password:** `admin123`
* *(Note: Change this password immediately in the Settings tab)*

### **2. Initial Setup (Admin Only)**

When you first launch, the database is empty. Follow this sequence:

1. **Create Bases:** Go to **📍 Locations > Add New**. Create your HQ and Forward Bases.
2. **Initialize Stock:** Go to **📦 Inventory > Stock Adjustments**. Select your HQ and perform a "Receipt" adjustment to add your starting inventory (e.g., 5000 units).

### **3. Daily Operations**

* **Logistics Team:** Use the **✈️ Movements** tab to transfer items. A "Mission ID" is required for every transfer.
* **Commanders:** Check the **📈 Analytics** tab daily to monitor "Days of Supply" and prevent stockouts.

---

## ❓ Troubleshooting

* **Error: "Port 5432 already in use"**
* *Cause:* You have another database running on this computer.
* *Fix:* Open `docker-compose.yml`, change the line `- "5432:5432"` to `- "5433:5432"`. Then run `docker-compose up --build` again.


* **How do I wipe the system and start fresh?**
* Run this command in the terminal: `docker-compose down -v` (The `-v` deletes the database volume).
